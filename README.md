Real-Time Voice Translator is a machine learning project that aims to provide a seamless and natural experience of cross-lingual communication. It uses deep neural networks to translate voice from one language to another in real time while preserving the tone and emotion of the speaker. It is a desktop application that supports Windows operating systems.

The application is easy to use: simply select the languages you want to translate between and start speaking. The application will listen to your voice and provide instant translations in real-time. You can also use the application to translate conversations between two or more people.
